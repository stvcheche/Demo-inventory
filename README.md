# Kefisinventory
This module has been developed in HTML, CSS and Javascript for the front end, PHP for the back-
end logic and MySQL for the database logic. This module is fully dynamic, that is all the page loading
requests are delivered from the server using AJAX POST requests thus leaving no trail of cached
history. This renders the browser back and forward button of no use. For any navigation
functionalities use the module’s UI elements, the browser’s forward and back button will not
navigate the module.
